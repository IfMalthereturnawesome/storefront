## Introduction: Mastering the Rhythm of Athletic Performance
In the realm of athletics, we often focus on obvious factors such as strength, speed, endurance, and technical skills.

<Banner>Yet, there's an unseen rhythm beating at the heart of every athlete's performance - the circadian rhythm. This natural biological cycle plays a significant role in our daily lives, controlling everything from our wakefulness to our physical performance.</Banner>

Today, we will explore the fascinating relationship between <SleepLib word="circadianRhythm">circadian rhythms</SleepLib> and athletic performance and how recognizing and synchronizing with these rhythms can take athletic performance to new heights.

## Tuning in to Our Circadian Rhythms: Unleashing the Power Within

Our bodies are meticulously synchronized machines, each function tuned to the steady beat of an internal clock — our circadian rhythm. This intricate system influences various bodily processes, from our <SleepLib word="sleepPattern">sleep patterns</SleepLib> to our peak alertness periods. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761508/" citationNumber={1}></ExternalLink>

Athletes, in particular, can harness the power of circadian rhythms for optimizing performance. For example, a curious pattern emerges from 40 years of win-loss records of west coast NFL teams. These teams consistently outperform when playing evening games on the East Coast. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24293776/" citationNumber={2}></ExternalLink>

The secret doesn't lie in their training regimes or strategy, but rather, in their circadian rhythms. Leveraging these natural biological cycles allows them to peak when it counts. <ExternalLink href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2023.1190956/full" citationNumber={3}></ExternalLink>

The influence of circadian rhythms on performance isn't exclusive to NFL teams. Field hockey players, for instance, show peak performance roughly four hours after waking up, as suggested by a study on the correlation between time since awakening and athletic performance. <ExternalLink href="https://www.dovepress.com/impact-of-chronotype-on-athletic-performance-current-perspectives-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CPT" citationNumber={4}></ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)01639-X" citationNumber={5}></ExternalLink>

Another facet of this relationship manifests in the hormonal responses to training. Charles Sturt University research showed that late-afternoon training fosters a more favorable anabolic hormone profile, marked by higher levels of testosterone — a critical muscle-building hormone — and lower cortisol levels, which is associated with muscle tissue breakdown. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15129828/" citationNumber={6}></ExternalLink>

A study on young soccer players further illustrates the intertwined nature of sleep, '<SleepLib word="chronotype">chronotype</SleepLib>' — whether someone is morning-oriented (M-type), neutral (N-type), or evening-oriented (E-type) — and performance. M-types excel in the morning, E-types in the evening, and sufficient sleep generally improves overall performance. <ExternalLink href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2023.1190956/full" citationNumber={3}></ExternalLink>

These insights hint at a potential revolution in coaching strategies. By tailoring training schedules to align with individual chronotypes and sleep patterns, young athletes could notably enhance their performance. Moreover, this could also inform strategic player selection for matches based on their timing.


## Training Schedules: Perfecting the Dance with Circadian Rhythms
Just as a maestro conducts an orchestra, managing training schedules in sync with our circadian rhythms can create a symphony of peak performance, optimal recovery, and improved well-being. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761508/" citationNumber={1}></ExternalLink>

However, as with any complex performance, it requires understanding, precision, and practice.

Michael Smolensky and Lynne Lamberg, authors of "The Body Clock Guide to Better Health," illustrate our bodies' fascinating daily cycles. According to them, our lowest body temperature is around 4:30 am, peaks around 7 pm, alertness reaches a peak around 10 am, the best coordination occurs mid-afternoon at 2:30 pm, followed by peak reaction time at 3:30 pm, and our greatest cardiovascular and muscle strength is around 5 pm.

Aligning our training schedules with these natural rhythms can help us perform at our best, when our bodies are primed for action. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15129828/" citationNumber={6}></ExternalLink>

For instance, training sessions that require quick reactions or intense cardiovascular and muscle work might be best scheduled for late afternoon when our bodies are naturally at their peak for such activities.

## Evening Training and Sleep Quality: Striking the Balance
Traditional wisdom cautions against exercising at night to maintain good <InternalLink word="sleepHabits">sleep hygiene</InternalLink>. However, a study in Sports Medicine contradicts this notion. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/" citationNumber={7}></ExternalLink> Researchers discovered that evening exercise, if it's not high-intensity and if conducted at least one hour before bedtime, doesn't affect sleep negatively. In fact, it seemed to expedite the <SleepLib word="sleepOnset">sleep onset</SleepLib> and deepen the <SleepLib word="sleepQuality">sleep quality</SleepLib>.

Nonetheless, the intensity of the exercise is crucial. High-intensity activities like interval training, performed less than an hour before bedtime, led to longer sleep onset and poorer sleep quality.

Therefore, the timing of exercise and its proximity to sleep significantly influence sleep quality.

In situations where athletes don't have the flexibility to adjust their training schedules, interventions like <SleepLib word="melatonin">melatonin</SleepLib> intake after an evening exercise session can help reset the circadian rhythm and mitigate effects on sleep quality. <ExternalLink href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420528.2018.1474891?journalCode=icbi20" citationNumber={8}></ExternalLink>


## Circadian Rhythms and Performance: Future Research and Developments
Ongoing research focuses on a range of topics from investigating the best time of day for different types of training (strength vs. endurance, for example) to developing personalized training schedules based on an individual's unique circadian rhythm.

The potential to tailor training programs to align with biological rhythms opens up a whole new avenue for performance optimization.

## Conclusion
In wrapping up into the effects of circadian rhythms on athletic performance, we've discovered the profound influence of synchronizing our internal <SleepLib word="biologicalClock">biological clocks</SleepLib> with training schedules. This growing field holds the potential to transform our understanding of training, competition, and recovery in athletics.

However, despite our best efforts to synchronize training with circadian rhythms, there's one unavoidable hurdle that athletes often encounter – travel. <SleepLib word="jetLag">Jet lag</SleepLib> and travel <SleepLib word="fatigue">fatigue</SleepLib> pose significant challenges to maintaining peak performance levels, especially when crossing multiple time zones.

As we venture further into the complex world of sleep and performance, we invite you to explore the next chapter in our Sleep Athletics resource, <InternalLink word="jetLagAndTravelFatigue">Managing Jet lag & Travel Fatigue in Athletes</InternalLink>. This article will delve into the often underestimated impact of these phenomena on athletic performance. We'll elucidate the subtle effects of jet lag and travel fatigue, and arm you with practical strategies to counter these challenges.
