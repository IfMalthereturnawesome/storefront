## Introduction:
Welcome back to our <InternalLink word="sleepAthleticsResource">Sleep Athletics Resource</InternalLink> series! As we have navigated through the previous six articles, we've unravelled the key roles that sleep plays in enhancing various aspects of athletic performance, from speed, power, and endurance to reaction time, accuracy, and skill improvement. Now, we shift our focus towards another fundamental area - how sleeps helps athletes recover from injuries and reduce the risk of sustaining new ones.

This seventh article in the series is all about illustrating the undeniable link between sleep and injury recovery in athletes. By weaving together scientific research and the experiences of athletes around the world, we aim to shed light on how sleep becomes an essential ally in an athlete's training, contributing to reducing injury risk and accelerating recovery.

Research has shown that a lack of quality sleep can result in decreased athletic performance, increased risk of injury, and slower recovery post-injury. <ExternalLink href="https://journals.lww.com/pedorthopaedics/Fulltext/2014/03000/Chronic_Lack_of_Sleep_is_Associated_With_Increased.1.aspx" citationNumber={1}></ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21694586/" citationNumber={2}></ExternalLink>

## The Science Behind Sleep and Recovery
Sleep, a complex yet vital physiological process, is as integral to an athlete's regimen as a proper diet and targeted training. During sleep, particularly the Non-Rapid Eye Movement (<SleepLib word="nonRapidEyeMovementSleep">NREM</SleepLib>) stage, the body enters a state of anabolic activity, focusing on cell growth and repair, which is essential for athletes engaged in intensive training and competitions. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25756787/" citationNumber={3}></ExternalLink>

During this NREM Sleep, the body secretes Human Growth Hormone (HGH), a pivotal agent for tissue repair, muscle, and bone development. This hormone plays a crucial role in regenerating cells, repairing muscle tissue damage, replenishing depleted energy stores, and compensating for fluid loss incurred during strenuous activities. This mechanism aids in muscle recovery and growth, helping athletes recover faster and more effectively. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27367265/" citationNumber={4}></ExternalLink>

Additionally, sleep enhances the immune system's functionality, increasing its efficiency in warding off infections that could potentially hinder an athlete's performance. In essence, quality sleep creates an environment conducive to comprehensive recovery and repair, reinforcing its role as a pillar of exercise recovery. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26206724/" citationNumber={5}></ExternalLink>

### Cortisol: Taming the Stress Hormone
Cortisol, often referred to as the "stress hormone," has a profound impact on an athlete's body. Chronic stress and <InternalLink word="symptomsOfSleepDeprivation">sleep deprivation</InternalLink> often lead to elevated cortisol levels, resulting in slower recovery, decreased immune function, and increased risk of injury. Quality sleep acts as a natural antidote, helping to regulate and lower cortisol levels. This effect not only fosters a faster recovery but also bolsters resistance to illnesses, safeguarding an athlete's training capacity. <ExternalLink href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1207/s15327558ijbm0201_2" citationNumber={6}></ExternalLink>

### The Testosterone Factor: Sleep and Hormone Regulation
Testosterone plays a significant role in athletic performance, contributing to muscle mass, strength, and overall vigor. Notably, the majority of daily testosterone release in men occurs during sleep. Disrupted or inadequate sleep can lead to lower testosterone levels, influencing various aspects of performance and recovery. By ensuring sufficient sleep, athletes can optimize their testosterone levels, thereby enhancing recovery and reducing the risk of overuse injuries. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4445839/" citationNumber={7}></ExternalLink>

## Sleep and Injury Risk: The Connection
Recent studies have linked <SleepLib word="chronic">chronic</SleepLib> <SleepLib word="sleepDeprivation">sleep deprivation</SleepLib> with a higher risk of musculoskeletal injuries. A study involving adolescent athletes found that those who slept for less than 8 hours each night had a 1.7 times higher risk of injury compared to those who had ample sleep. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21200339/" citationNumber={8}></ExternalLink>

Another study conducted on collegiate athletes found a similar association. Athletes who maintained good <InternalLink word="sleepHabits">sleep habits</InternalLink> were less likely to suffer injuries associated with elevated stress levels. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307962/" citationNumber={9}></ExternalLink>

## Sleep Deprivation: The Impact on Athletes
<SleepLib word="insufficientSleep">Insufficient sleep</SleepLib> can critically impact an athlete's performance, overall well-being, and training capacity. Sleep deprivation manifests in myriad detrimental ways, from negative effects on <InternalLink word="accuracyReactionTimeSleep">reaction time and accuracy</InternalLink> to significant reductions in <InternalLink word="sleepSpeedPowerAndEndurance">strength and endurance</InternalLink>. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23974210/" citationNumber={10}></ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988893/" citationNumber={11}></ExternalLink>

Even a single night of inadequate sleep can lead to a decrease in running abilities, a reduction in muscle glycogen levels, and a weakening of submaximal strength <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27574901/" citationNumber={12}></ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26206724/" citationNumber={5}></ExternalLink>.

The toll of sleep deprivation extends beyond physical performance and directly impacts mental health and cognitive functioning. Chronic sleep deprivation can induce mood changes, <InternalLink word="sleepAndLearning">decreased cognitive function</InternalLink>, and an increased risk of injury. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4771153/" citationNumber={13}></ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9706412/" citationNumber={14}></ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1978335/" citationNumber={15}></ExternalLink>

By prioritizing sleep, athletes can effectively manage inflammation and protect their training capacity, enabling consistent performance and progress.

## Sleep and Injury Recovery
Quality sleep plays a significant role in recovery from injuries. It aids in the repair of damaged tissues and reduces inflammation. Sleep also helps in managing pain and discomfort associated with injuries. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27015382/" citationNumber={16}></ExternalLink>

Moreover, it has been found that sleep can affect concussion recovery time. Athletes who suffered from <SleepLib word="sleepDisturbance">sleep disturbances</SleepLib> post-concussion had a prolonged recovery period. <ExternalLink href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0883073819849741" citationNumber={17}></ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32132474/" citationNumber={18}></ExternalLink>

## Sleep and Nutrition: Injury Risk Reduction in Athletes
Sleep and nutrition stand as twin pillars supporting an athlete's health and performance. A study by von Rosen and colleagues demonstrates how getting adequate sleep and adhering to a nutritious diet could significantly decrease the risk of sustaining a new injury among adolescent elite athletes. <ExternalLink href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.12735" citationNumber={19}></ExternalLink>

The study, involving 340 adolescent elite athletes, showed that failing to meet the recommended intake of fruits, vegetables, and fish, and not getting enough sleep during weekdays had potential implications on injury risk. Athletes sleeping more than 8 hours on weekdays reduced the odds of injury by 61%, and those meeting the recommended nutrition intake slashed their injury odds by 64%. This valuable insight underscores the significant role of sleep and nutrition in injury risk reduction among athletes.

While nutrition can impact <SleepLib word="sleepQuality">sleep quality</SleepLib>, sleep can reciprocally influence dietary choices <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24791913/" citationNumber={20}></ExternalLink>. Sleep deprivation could lead to alterations in hunger <SleepLib word="hormones">hormones</SleepLib>, increasing appetite and cravings for high-carb and high-fat foods. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10543671/" citationNumber={21}></ExternalLink> These dietary changes could impinge on an athlete's performance. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30979048/" citationNumber={22}></ExternalLink>

Conversely, some nutrients can enhance sleep quality. Foods rich in free <SleepLib word="tryptophan">tryptophan</SleepLib>, magnesium, and <SleepLib word="melatonin">melatonin</SleepLib> can aid in improving sleep quality. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27633109/" citationNumber={23}></ExternalLink> Therefore, an informed selection of nutrients can contribute to better sleep, which in turn could play a pivotal role in an athlete's health and performance.

This crucial intertwining of sleep and nutrition showcases their combined importance in the athletic arena. Prioritizing both sleep and nutrition is not merely a strategy to boost performance but an integral part of maintaining health and reducing injury risk.

With proper sleep and nutrition, athletes can better equip themselves for the strenuous demands of their sport and potentially extend their careers by staying healthier for longer.

## Prioritizing Sleep: Key to Enhancing Athletic Training and Performance
If you're an athlete and find yourself struggling to keep up with your training, you might want to take a closer look at your sleeping habits. It's no secret that sleep deprivation can have a significant impact on your physical and mental health. Lack of sleep can lead to an increased proinflammatory state, leaving you more vulnerable to infections and reducing your endurance and potential for progress. To protect your training capacity and ensure consistent performance, it's crucial to prioritize quality sleep as part of your training regimen.

Aim for <InternalLink word="sleepNeeds">7–10 hours of sleep during the night</InternalLink>, and if you're an athlete in training, you may need even more. If you're not getting enough sleep, try to make up for it with naps. Naps can help you recover from sleep deprivation and improve your performance.

## Strategies to Improve Sleep Quality
Athletes often grapple with demanding competition, travel schedules, and intense training, all of which can hinder their ability to achieve restful sleep. Prioritizing sleep is essential, yet some athletes struggle to both fall asleep and stay asleep. This is where good <InternalLink word="sleepHabits">sleep habits</InternalLink> can become a game-changer. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988893/" citationNumber={11}></ExternalLink>

<SleepLib word="sleepHygiene">Sleep hygiene</SleepLib> encompasses regular routines and the creation of a conducive <SleepLib word="sleepEnvironment">sleep environment</SleepLib>, all designed to promote healthier sleep habits, as illustrated in Table 1.

For athletes interested in going the extra mile for their sleep health, Table 2 suggests further strategies.

Adopting every single sleep habit recommendation may be impractical for some athletes, but incorporating as many as feasible can greatly enhance this essential aspect of overall well-being and performance.

#### Table 1 - Sleep Habits: Recommendations
| No. | Recommendations |
| --- | --------------- |
| 1 | Don't go to bed until you are sleepy. If you aren't sleepy, get out of bed and do something else until you become sleepy. |
| 2 | Regular bedtime routines/rituals help you relax and prepare your body for bed (reading, warm bath, etc.). |
| 3 | Try to get up at the same time every morning (including weekends and holidays). |
| 4 | Try to get a full night's sleep every night, and avoid <SleepLib word="nap">naps</SleepLib> during day if possible (if you must nap, limit to 1 h and avoid nap after 3 p.m.). |
| 5 | Use the bed for sleep and intimacy only; not for any other activities such as TV, computer or phone use, etc. |
| 6 | Avoid caffeine if possible (if must use caffeine, avoid after lunch). |
| 7 | Avoid alcohol if possible (if must use alcohol, avoid right before bed). |
| 8 | Do not smoke cigarettes or use nicotine, ever. |
| 9 | Consider avoiding high-intensity exercise right before bed (extremely intense exercise may raise cortisol, which impairs sleep). |
| 10 | Make sure bedroom is quiet, as dark as possible, and a little on the cool side rather than warm (similar to a cave). |

#### Table 2 - Sleep Habits: Additional Sleep Strategies
| No. | Tips & Tricks |
| --- | --------------- |
| 1 | Avoid <SleepLib word="blueLight">blue light</SleepLib> emitted from screens at least 2 h before bed (smartphones, laptop, monitors). Blue light suppresses melatonin production that is needed to induce sleep. Avoid text messaging, social media, games, app use. |
| 2 | Get bright, <SleepLib word="naturalLight">natural light</SleepLib> (the sun) upon awakening (the sun is ideal, but some suggest at least a 10,000 lux lamp if artificial). |
| 3 | Don't hit the snooze button. It does not improve sleep quality. |
| 4 | If you have difficulty waking up, some suggest a dawn-simulator alarm clock. |
| 5 | If you must use your computer at night, consider installing color-adjusting and blue-light reducing software or wear blue-light blocking glasses. |
| 6 | Meditation may be helpful. Brainwave <SleepLib word="entrainment">entrainment</SleepLib> (e. g., binaural beats) is considered experimental. |
| 7 | Higher carbohydrate (namely high glycemic index foods) at night may improve sleep, as well as high protein including tryptophan. High fat intake at night may disrupt sleep. Inadequate total caloric intake during the day may impair sleep at night. |
| 8 | Topical magnesium (e. g., salt bath, topical mineral oil) or oral magnesium may help if you are deficient. |
| 9 | Melatonin naturally occurring in foods (e. g., tart cherry juice, raspberries, goji berries, walnuts, almonds, tomatoes) may potentially improve sleep, but avoid artificial melatonin supplements. |
| 10 | Don't fall asleep to the TV. Sleep studies show you frequently wake up during the night and have poor quality sleep. |
| 11 | Herbal supplements are largely unknown with potential serious side effects, and may be on USADA-prohibited lists or result in positive banned substance test for athletes. |
| 12 | Consider reducing your fluid intake before bed so you don't get up to go to the bathroom (only if you maintain enough hydration during the day). |
| 13 | Cooling your body temperature may improve sleep. Some suggest keeping room between 60–70 degrees; however, keep hands and feet warm (socks and gloves may help during winter months). |
| 14 | Check your mattress - it may be too old (mattresses typically last a maximum of 9–10 years) and may have allergens. |
| 15 | Recovery from exercise should not only focus on muscle recovery. Reducing mental <SleepLib word="fatigue">fatigue</SleepLib> is just as important for healthy sleep. Reduce external stressors in your life. |


For athletes traveling across time zones, <InternalLink word="jetLagAndTravelFatigue">managing jet lag</InternalLink> is also important. Strategies can include adjusting the sleep schedule to the new time zone a few days before traveling and staying well-hydrated <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17398311/" citationNumber={24}></ExternalLink>.
