## Introduction: The Impact of Jet Lag and Travel Fatigue on Athletes
International sporting events are a thrilling prospect for athletes worldwide. These competitions provide an opportunity to showcase talent, represent countries, and engage with different cultures. However, there is a subtle challenge lurking beneath this exciting exterior: Jet lag and travel fatigue.

As an athlete, you spend hours honing your physical strength and mental acuity, but these unseen adversaries can throw your preparation off-balance. But don't fret. In this article, we delve into the ins and outs of these issues, uncovering how they might hinder your performance and, most importantly, how to mitigate their effects.

## Jet Lag and Travel Fatigue: What Are They?
The disruptive effects of jet lag and travel fatigue on athletic performance often go unnoticed.

<SleepLib word="jetLag">Jetlag</SleepLib> disrupts our body's internal timekeeper, leading to decreased focus, increased errors, and a notable drop in motivation.

Travel fatigue, on the other hand, stems from long journeys causing physical and psychological discomfort that can gradually accumulate over a competitive season. Understanding these nuances can aid in planning efficient training schedules and travel arrangements.

## Jet Lag in Athletes: The Hidden Hurdle to Top Performance
When athletes compete in international competitions, they're often well-prepared physically and mentally. Yet, one unforeseen challenge might impact their performance – jet lag. This invisible adversary disrupts their <SleepLib word="circadianRhythm">circadian rhythms</SleepLib>, an internal timekeeper that influences various physiological processes such as alertness and muscle strength. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3409332/" citationNumber={1}></ExternalLink>

Jetlag and the consequent loss of sleep can lead to decreased focus, increased errors, higher risk of injuries, and a distinct drop in motivation and complex mental performance. While the extent of jet lag's impact varies among athletes, its influence on our body's natural rhythms and peak performance is evident.

Interestingly, not all athletes experience jet lag similarly, indicating a personal variance in the response to such disruptions. This difference may stem from multiple factors, including an athlete's <SleepLib word="chronotype">chronotype</SleepLib> (whether they are morning or evening-oriented) and their physical fitness.

In the field of <SleepLib word="chronobiology">chronobiology</SleepLib> – the study of how time influences our physiological variables, <InternalLink word="circadianRhythmsAthleticPerformance">circadian rhythms</InternalLink> are understood to have a significant impact on performance. Yet, other factors such as fatigue and <SleepLib word="sleepDisturbance">sleep disturbances</SleepLib> often confound these relationships, making it challenging to draw firm conclusions. <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30741586/" citationNumber={2}></ExternalLink>

It's not just alertness or quick responses that jet lag affects. Our body's natural rhythms can sway peak performance times for various sports components, like flexibility and muscle strength. Ever experienced a dip in performance post-lunch? That's your body clock at work.

These findings underscore the need for athletes and their support teams to consider the effects of jet lag when planning training and competition schedules, especially for events that involve travel across multiple time zones.

The below strategies, combined with the <InternalLink word="circadianRhythm">understanding of circadian rhythms</InternalLink>, can help athletes better prepare for international competitions and maintain their peak performance levels.

## Jet Lag Mitigation

The effect of jet lag can be reduced by following certain interventions. This includes adjusting your body's core body temperature minimum (CBTmin) and utilizing non-pharmacological methods.

When traveling, many individuals notice that jet lag tends to be more severe when going east as opposed to west.<ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20204161/" citationNumber={3}></ExternalLink> This is due to the fact that it's typically simpler to slow down your internal clock rather than speed it up. However, contrary to common belief, north-south flights can also result in jet lag, even when they don't cross multiple time zones, primarily due to changes in daylength. <ExternalLink href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519317304575?via%3Dihub" citationNumber={4}></ExternalLink>

Here are some strategies based on the direction of travel:

### Phase-Delay (Traveling West)

- **Adjusting CBTmin**: Advance your CBTmin by 0.5 days (2 hours per day) per time-zone crossed during adaptation.

- **Light Exposure**: Maximize light exposure in the evening before CBTmin and avoid light in the morning after CBTmin. Supplement <SleepLib word="naturalLight">natural light</SleepLib> with artificial bright light as needed.

- **Sleep Management**: Optimize sleep, aiming for a minimum of 7-9 hours per day. Schedule your flight strategically to allow for adequate sleep and minimize <InternalLink word="symptomsOfSleepDeprivation">sleep deprivation</InternalLink>.

- **Exercise**: Engage in low-intensity aerobic exercise to feel less fatigued. Avoid exercising during recommended sleep times.

- **Nutrition**: Plan and prepare meals in advance to improve food choices and meet nutritional needs. Delay sleep by up to 1 hour each successive day prior to travel, while maintaining at least 7-8 hours of sleep per day.

### Phase-Advance (Traveling East)

- **Adjusting CBTmin**: Delay your CBTmin by 1 day (1 hour per day) per time-zone crossed during adaptation.

- **Light Exposure**: Avoid light in the evening before CBTmin and maximize light exposure in the morning after CBTmin.

- **Sleep Management**: Attempt to sleep when possible, considering the "sleep window" aligned with the night at the place of departure. Advance sleep by up to 1 hour each successive day prior to travel, while maintaining at least 7-9 hours of sleep per day.

- **Exercise**: Incorporate periodic activity every 2 hours outside of the "sleep window", such as isometric exercises, walks along the aisles or stretching exercises.

- **Nutrition**: Gradually shift eating and sleep schedule by 30-60 min each day towards the destination time for a few days before departure.

### Non-pharmacological Interventions

- **Light**: Sunlight is the most dominant environmental signal for the circadian system. Use <SleepLib word="blueLight">blue light</SleepLib> spectrum filter glasses and artificial bright light as needed.

- **Sleep**: Sleep preservation is the mainstay of jet lag management. Apply good <InternalLink word="sleepHabits">sleep hygiene</InternalLink> practices at the destination and consider strategic <SleepLib word="nap">nap</SleepLib>ping.

- **Exercise**: The appropriate time, intensity, and duration of exercise may induce a phase shift. Limit exercise intensity and complexity of movement patterns in the first few days after arrival.

- **Nutrition**: Meal composition and eating patterns can influence <SleepLib word="sleepArchitecture">sleep architecture</SleepLib> and enhance circadian adaptation. Follow the pattern of small, regular meals, and maintain good personal and food hygiene standards.

- **Hydration**: Maintain optimal hydration as per sports nutrition guidelines. Urine color can be used as a guide for hydration status.

### Pharmacological Interventions
In addition to non-pharmacological interventions, pharmacological interventions can also be considered to aid in mitigating jet lag symptoms. These interventions can provide targeted assistance based on the direction of travel and individual needs.

It is important to note that the use of pharmacological interventions should be done under the supervision and guidance of a healthcare professional.

Here are some pharmacological options to consider:

### Phase-Delay (Traveling West)

- **<SleepLib word="melatonin">Melatonin</SleepLib>**: Exogenous melatonin can be both <SleepLib word="hypnotic">hypnotic</SleepLib> (higher dose) and chronobiotic (lower dose). It is more beneficial when traveling east and crossing more time zones. Dosages range from 0.5-10mg, with 3-5mg considered the optimal dose to assist with faster <SleepLib word="sleepOnset">sleep onset</SleepLib> and better sleep. Administer until full adjustment has occurred at the destination. Athletes are strongly advised to clear melatonin use with their physician due to potential side effects such as headaches, nausea, daytime drowsiness, <SleepLib word="vividDream">vivid dreams</SleepLib>, and <SleepLib word="nightmare">nightmares</SleepLib>.

### Phase-Advance (Traveling East)

- **<SleepLib word="melatonin">Melatonin</SleepLib>**: Melatonin can also be used when traveling east. The timing of ingestion may differ depending on travel direction and the number of time zones crossed. It is recommended to take melatonin 4 hours after CBTmin during post-flight and 11.5 hours before CBTmin during both the flight and post-flight periods. Athletes should consult with their medical doctor before consuming melatonin and ensure appropriate administration based on the phase response curve (PRC) of melatonin.

- **Melatonin Analogues**: Melatonin analogues, such as Tasimelteon and Ramelteon, can also be considered. These analogues have been studied for their potential in aiding circadian adaptation, but further research is needed to fully understand their effectiveness in athletes.

- **<SleepLib word="sedative">Sedative</SleepLib>s (<SleepLib word="hypnotic">Hypnotic</SleepLib>s)**: Careful consideration should be given to the possible risk of deep venous thrombosis. Sedatives should preferably be administered only for up to 4 days after arrival at the destination. They can be reintroduced for athletes experiencing <SleepLib word="insomnia">insomnia</SleepLib> after 4 days, but only if previous use was tolerated with no adverse events. The decision to use sedatives should be made by a medical doctor based on individual assessment.

- **Stimulants (Armodafinil, slow-release caffeine)**: Armodafinil at a dose of 150mg/day has been successfully used for daytime sleepiness. Caffeine supplementation at a dose of 1mg/kg, preferably during the local morning and early afternoon, can be used to reduce sleepiness and increase alertness around training and competition. Athletes should avoid consuming caffeine late in the afternoon or evening, as it may interfere with nighttime sleep.

It is important for athletes to adhere to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) regulations regarding the use of pharmacological interventions and consult with their medical team to ensure compliance and the best course of action.

By combining non-pharmacological strategies with appropriate pharmacological interventions, athletes can optimize their adjustment to new time zones, alleviate jet lag symptoms, and enhance their overall performance.


## Travel Fatigue in Athletes: The you-can't-see-it-but-you-can-feel-it adversary
Unlike jet lag, which is a direct result of crossing multiple time zones, travel fatigue, a complex mix of physical, physiological, and psychological factors, often plagues athletes during long trips. Despite anecdotal evidence of its impact, there’s scant empirical data on its underlying mechanisms or how to lessen its effects.

Travel fatigue can stem from various internal and external factors, such as general health, uncomfortable travel conditions, restricted movement, dehydration due to dry cabin air, sleep disruptions, poor nutrition, stress, and disruption of daily routines. All these factors can contribute to travel fatigue, which can accumulate over a competitive season.

When assessing travel fatigue's impact on athletes, four factors are key: total travel distance, travel time (AM or PM), frequency of travel, and the length of the season. These collectively determine the "recovery window" or available time for recovery. This is especially crucial in professional sports with tight schedules and long-distance travel, like the NBA.

The exact effects of travel fatigue on athletes are still not fully understood. However, it's known to negatively affect perceptual measures like alertness, motivation, mood, perceived stress, and fatigue, even if it doesn't noticeably impact performance.

Several tools can monitor travel fatigue in athletes. The development of a travel fatigue scale could help understand its impact better and address specific symptoms like persistent fatigue, mood changes, and loss of motivation. Subjective ratings of <SleepLib word="sleepQuality">sleep quality</SleepLib>, stress/mood, fatigue, and recovery can also serve as indicators of travel fatigue.

In conclusion, travel fatigue is a significant challenge athletes face during long journeys. While empirical evidence on prevention strategies is lacking, acknowledging its impact and taking steps to mitigate it can help athletes maintain their performance and well-being.

## Travel Fatigue Mitigation: Strategies for Athletes

A systematic review indicates a lack of studies on interventions to manage travel fatigue in athletes, but some measures have been recommended based on expert opinions and collective experience. Here are the strategies athletes can implement before, during, and after travel:

### Pre-Travel Strategies

- **Protect Sleep**: Prioritize sufficient sleep and adjust sleep-wake patterns to match the destination's time zone before travel.

- **Planning**: Start planning as soon as event destinations and dates are known. Choose optimal travel options and schedules that allow for sufficient rest and reduce travel fatigue.

- **Training Synchronization**: Adjust training load and intensity to prepare for the relative rest associated with travel.

- **Illness Prevention and Nutrition**: Ensure vaccinations are updated and any recurrent illnesses are treated. Implement an evidence-based nutrition and hydration plan to meet macro- and micro-nutrient needs, as well as fluid needs, well in advance of travel.

### During-Travel Strategies

- **Sleep and Compression**: Nap when appropriate, use aids like sleep-masks or earplugs, and wear medical-grade compression clothes to promote blood flow.

- **Illness Prevention**: Follow guidelines to prevent the spread of illness and maintain hygiene during the journey.

- **Refuel and Rehydrate**: Follow a hydration plan configured pre-travel and eat regular but smaller meals. Avoid caffeinated beverages and foods at least ±6 h before bed or sleep time.

- **Stopovers**: Engage in frequent movement, stretching, and walking around to promote circulation and reduce stiffness.

### Post-Travel Strategies

- **Sleep and Rest**: Nap when appropriate and maintain <SleepLib word="sleepHygiene">sleep hygiene</SleepLib>. Take strategic brief naps early in the day to not interfere with nighttime sleep.

- **Refuel and Rehydrate**: Follow the nutrition plan configured pre-travel. Manage any gastrointestinal issues that may occur during or after travel.

- **Caffeine**: Consider strategic intake during the local morning but avoid it in the late afternoon or evening.

- **Training**: Engage in low to moderate intensity training upon arrival and avoid extended video sessions.

- **Other Considerations**: Screen for <SleepLib word="sleepDisorders">sleep disorders</SleepLib> in pre-season and manage effects of altitude on sleep if relevant.

Moreover, athletes can consider the sensible use of melatonin, under the supervision of a healthcare provider, to aid in <SleepLib word="sleepRegulation">sleep regulation</SleepLib>. This comprehensive approach can help athletes manage travel fatigue and jet lag, and optimize performance when traveling across time zones. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8279034/" citationNumber={5}></ExternalLink>
