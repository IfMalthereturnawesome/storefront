## Privacy-friendly Policy

Welcome to the Cookie Policy for Eight Athletics ApS. This Cookie Policy explains how and why we don't use cookies on our site.

## 1. Do We Use Cookies?

_In Short: No, we don't._

We do not use cookies on our website. Our website analytics solution is privacy-friendly and does not require the use of cookies.

## 2. What Information Do We Collect?

We collect the following information on our website:

- Pages visited
- Referrer and UTM campaign parameters
- Country of origin, city, and language
- Operating system, browser, and screen resolution
- Custom events
- User-Agent separated from the page views

This information is stored and will never be shared or sold.

## 3. How Do We Recognize Visitors?

We generate a unique number for each visitor calculated from the visitor's IP address, the User-Agent, and a random string that is set for each website. This unique number ensures visitors can be identified without collecting personal data. The random string guarantees the number varies between websites, so they cannot be matched. To comply with GDPR, sessions are recorded for a maximum of 24 hours. After that, the visitor is assigned a new unique number.

## 4. How Is Your Data Protected?

We operate under strict European privacy laws. We do not track our visitors or collect personal data. We do not sell your data to third parties.

A visit to our website can result in the storage on our server of information about the access (date, time, page accessed). This does not represent any analysis of personal data (e.g., name, address, or e-mail address).

If personal data are collected, this only occurs – to the extent possible – with the prior consent of the user of the website. Any forwarding of the data to third parties without the express consent of the user shall not take place.

We would like to expressly point out that the transmission of data via the Internet (e.g., by e-mail) can offer security vulnerabilities. It is therefore impossible to safeguard the data completely against access by third parties. We cannot assume any liability for damages arising as a result of such security vulnerabilities.

The use by third parties of all published contact details for the purpose of advertising is expressly excluded. We reserve the right to take legal steps in the case of the unsolicited sending of advertising information; e.g., by means of spam mail.

## 5. Your Rights

Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by us, in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, PECR, and Schrems II. In particular, Users have the right to withdraw their consent, object to the processing of their Data, access their Data, verify and seek rectification, restrict the processing of their Data, have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed, receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller, and lodge a complaint.

If you have any questions or wish to exercise these rights, you can contact us at info@eightathletics.com.

## 6. Changes to This Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this Cookie Policy frequently to be informed of how we are managing your information.
