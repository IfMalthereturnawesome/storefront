Thank you for your purchase. We hope you are happy with your purchase. However, if you are not completely satisfied with your purchase for any reason, you may return it to us for a full refund or an exchange. Please see below for more information on our return policy.

## Returns
All returns must be postmarked within thirty (30) days of the purchase date. All returned items must be in new and unused condition, with all original tags and labels attached.

## Custom Products Returns

We understand that purchasing made-to-order items represents a significant commitment on your part. To support your decision to choose our custom products, we extend the same return policy to these purchases as we do for our standard items. This includes our custom-fit sleep masks, which are individually designed based on a video of your face.

Although we're not required by law to accept returns on these custom products, your satisfaction is our priority. Like with our standard products, you may return your custom item for a full refund or exchange within thirty (30) days of the purchase date. All returned custom items must be in new and unused condition. Please note that due to the unique nature of these products, the processing time for returns and exchanges might take slightly longer. We appreciate your patience in this matter.

To initiate a return for a custom product, please follow the same Return Process as outlined above, contacting customer service to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.

## Return Process

To return an item, please email customer service at info@eightathletics.com to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number. After receiving a RMA number, place the item securely in its original packaging and include your proof of purchase, then mail your return to the following address:
