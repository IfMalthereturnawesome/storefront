You often hear people brag about their lack of sleep in movies, TV shows, and even casual conversations. Yet you rarely hear anyone brag about getting too much sleep.

Many believe that sacrificing sleep is essential for success. Others might think oversleeping is a "luxury problem," especially when compared to involuntary <InternalLink word="symptomsOfSleepDeprivation">sleep deprivation</InternalLink>.

If you're grappling with insufficient sleep, you might envy those who seem to get too much. Conversely, if you sleep more than needed and still feel drained, you might wish you could be the "efficient" one clocking in just five hours a night.

**But can you really sleep too much?**

Here at Eight Athletics, we understand both perspectives. If forced to pick, we'd rather get too much sleep than too little. Why? Simple. <SleepLib word="sleepDeprivation">sleep deprivation</SleepLib> is downright harmful, but oversleeping isn't a walk in the park either.

Quality sleep enhances efficiency and well-being, but only to an extent. So, what are the repercussions of too much sleep? How can you optimize your sleep to feel refreshed without needing 10-hour nights?

## Why is oversleeping unhealthy?

Sleep is crucial; it rejuvenates your body and mind. But excessive sleep can be a double-edged sword, leading to diminished productivity, a lower quality of life, and even health risks.

The National Sleep Foundation advises adults to get 7-9 hours of sleep each night for optimal health <ExternalLink href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need" citationNumber={1}></ExternalLink>. Oversleeping could predispose you to ailments such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and even cancer.

Oversleep and you'll likely feel lethargic, forgetful, and drained all day.

## How much sleep is excessive?

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to the ideal sleep duration because individual needs vary.

Still, most adults should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep. Exceptions include young adults or those recovering from sleep loss or illness <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434546/" citationNumber={2}></ExternalLink>.

Various factors, including stress levels, can alter sleep requirements. But consistently clocking in over 9 hours could signify a lack of quality REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep <ExternalLink href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.792942/full" citationNumber={3}></ExternalLink>.

Insufficient <InternalLink word="remSleep">REM Sleep</InternalLink> disrupts the brain's ability to process memories and regenerate. It also messes with your body's <SleepLib word="circadianRhythm">circadian rhythm</SleepLib> <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8935364/" citationNumber={4}></ExternalLink>, impacting your day-to-day energy levels.

Sleeping over 9-12 hours consistently could also lead to health complications like a weakened immune system, obesity <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25226585/" citationNumber={5}></ExternalLink>, and diabetes <ExternalLink href="https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/understanding-diabetes-detection-treatment" citationNumber={7}></ExternalLink>.

If you have underlying health issues, always consult your physician for personalized advice.

## What Happens When You Sleep Too Much?

Sure, we've established that excessive sleep isn't a good thing. But what precisely does "too much sleep" do to you? It turns out the effects span both physical and mental health dimensions.

Studies indicate that regularly sleeping more than 9 hours a day can elevate your risk of depression and stress. Intriguingly, a large-scale study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2856739/" citationNumber={8}></ExternalLink> reveals that people logging more than 9 hours of sleep per day face a higher mortality rate. The study, conducted over 17 years on more than a million nurses, found that long sleepers had a roughly 8% higher chance of premature death from any cause compared to those sleeping 6-8 hours.

## So, Why Do Some People Oversleep?

Sleep is a cornerstone of well-being, claiming roughly a third of our lives. Yet some people are sleeping away more than the recommended third. Why? The reasons can be multifaceted, and they might include:

### Psychological Factors:

If you're experiencing prolonged fatigue despite clocking enough sleep hours, it might be time to consider the consequences of oversleeping. It can negatively impact both your personal relationships and work performance.

Seek medical advice if you suspect you're getting too much sleep. Chronic oversleeping can have long-term repercussions.

### Sleep disorders and other conditions that can lead to oversleeping

Sleep disorders are more common than you might think, and often, they go undiagnosed. If you're consistently sleeping beyond what's recommended or experiencing symptoms indicative of a sleep disorder, consult your healthcare provider.

The following are some prevalent sleep disorders that can lead to excessive sleeping:

- **<SleepLib word="narcolepsy">Narcolepsy</SleepLib>**: This neurological disorder is marked by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/narcolepsy-fact-sheet" citationNumber={10}></ExternalLink>

- **Idiopathic hypersomnia**: This condition often results from neurotransmitter dysfunction, causing the brain to produce excessive melatonin and resulting in debilitating fatigue. <ExternalLink href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypersomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20362332" citationNumber={11}></ExternalLink>

- **REM Sleep Behavior Disorder**: This disorder causes individuals to physically act out their dreams during REM sleep, leading to daytime sleep deprivation. <ExternalLink href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rem-sleep-behavior-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352920" citationNumber={12}></ExternalLink>

- **Restless legs**: This syndrome makes it difficult to relax your legs, especially at bedtime. <ExternalLink href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20377174" citationNumber={13}></ExternalLink>

- **Sleep apnea**: This breathing disorder interrupts your sleep cycle and can lead to further health issues. <ExternalLink href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631" citationNumber={14}></ExternalLink>

- **Severe obesity**: Excessive weight can hinder quality sleep by causing poor circulation and heart issues. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2279744/" citationNumber={15}></ExternalLink>

### How much sleep do you actually need?

Generally, adults should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep. But life stage and individual factors can shift this baseline. Anything below 7 hours or above 9 is usually considered unhealthy.

Getting sufficient sleep isn't just a luxuryâ€”it's a cornerstone of good health, akin to proper hydration and nutrition. While the immediate effects of sleep deprivation may not be apparent, long-term neglect can wreak havoc on your well-being.

According to extensive scientific research, quality sleep offers numerous benefits:

- Extends your lifespan
- Enhances memory and creativity
- Makes you more attractive
- Helps with weight management
- Lowers cancer and dementia risks
- Boosts immunity against common illnesses
- Reduces heart attack and blood clot risks
- Elevates your mood and mental well-being
- Improves athletic performance
- Increases productivity and efficiency

## Conclusion

It's possible to get too much sleep, but sleeping more than 9 hours may not necessarily be excessive. Over-sleeping may indicate a lack of REM sleep or an underlying sleep condition. Environmental factors, such as light or temperature, could also be the culprit.

Athletes or those who engage in high-intensity workouts may actually benefit from sleeping more than 9 hours. <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3119836/" citationNumber={16}></ExternalLink>
