Sleep has been a subject of discussion for many years. A common myth is that kids require less sleep than adults. On the contrary, children not only need more sleep than adults, but it's also essential they sleep during the right hours. So, how much sleep do children really need?

Recent research offers insight into children's sleep needs. A study by the University of Pennsylvania <ExternalLink href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/link-between-midday-naps-and-happier-children-excel-academically-fewer-behavioral-problems" citationNumber={1}></ExternalLink> found that children with irregular <SleepLib word="sleepPattern">sleep patterns</SleepLib> face higher risks of cognitive and mental health issues.

Another study by the same university <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910624/" citationNumber={2}></ExternalLink> indicates that children with shorter <SleepLib word="sleepDuration">sleep durations</SleepLib> tend to exhibit more emotional and behavioral issues. Pinpointing sleep problems in children can be intricate, stemming from various factors including developmental, medical, environmental, or psychological.

## Why is a good night's sleep crucial for kids?

For children, <InternalLink word="deepSleep">deep sleep</InternalLink> plays a pivotal role in growth, learning, and overall health.

Sleep deprivation can hinder a child's development, concentration in school, decision-making skills, mood, weight, and even immune function.

Alarmingly, about 30% of children aged 6-13 aren't getting adequate sleep <ExternalLink href="https://www.luneeo.com/deep-sleep-what-is-it-and-are-you-getting-enough/" citationNumber={3}></ExternalLink> <SleepLib word="deepSleep">deep sleep</SleepLib>. It's imperative for educators and parents to recognize the impact <InternalLink word="symptomsOfSleepDeprivation">sleep deprivation</InternalLink> can have on a child's academic and emotional well-being.

Consistently sleeping at least 10 hours a night has been linked to positive outcomes in emotional development, learning engagement, and academic success during the early school years <ExternalLink href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2021-054362/188501/Sleep-Duration-and-Kindergarten-Adjustment?autologincheck=redirected" citationNumber={4}></ExternalLink>.

## How do children's sleep needs differ from adults?

The National Sleep Foundation reports varied sleep needs between adults and children. While adults may need around 8 hours, children typically require between 10-14 hours. Children's sleep also cycles from <InternalLink word="lightSleep">light</InternalLink> to <SleepLib word="deepSleep">deep</SleepLib> stages.

Considering the ongoing development of children's brains, they naturally require more rest than adults. This underscores the recommendation for children to achieve at least 10 hours of sleep daily.
