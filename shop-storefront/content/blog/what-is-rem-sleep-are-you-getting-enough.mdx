Many folks think the main job of REM sleep is to dream, but that's not the whole story.

REM sleep has many critical roles, from brain development to emotional well-being.

In this article, we'll dive into the ins and outs of REM sleep, why it's essential, the downside of lacking it, and the <SleepLib word="sleepDisorders">sleep disorders</SleepLib> linked to this <SleepLib word="sleepStages">sleep stage</SleepLib>.

### What happens during non-REM sleep?

The initial sleep stage is known as non-REM sleep and has four stages: N1, N2, and N3.

**Stage 1**:

Your eyes are shut, but waking you up is easy.

This stage usually lasts for 5 to 10 minutes.

**Stage 2**:

You're drifting off.

Your heart rate and body temp drop a bit.

Your body starts gearing up for <InternalLink word="deepSleep">deep sleep</InternalLink>.

This stage sticks around for 10 to 25 minutes.

**Stage 3**:

Welcome to deep sleep.

Waking you up now isn't easy, and if someone does, you'll feel disoriented for a bit.

In these deep stages of <SleepLib word="nonRapidEyeMovementSleep">NREM sleep</SleepLib>, your body repairs tissue, builds bone and muscle, and boosts your immune system.

### What is REM sleep?

REM sleep is a crucial <InternalLink word="stagesOfSleep">sleep stage</InternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31910377/" citationNumber={1}></ExternalLink>. It's marked by quick eye movements and dreams. The REM cycle alternates with non-REM sleep roughly every 90 to 120 minutes.

REM sleep wraps up each <SleepLib word="sleepCycle">sleep cycle</SleepLib>.

It's the last stage before a new sleep cycle kicks in.

Important traits of REM sleep include: <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" citationNumber={2}></ExternalLink>

- Tied to dreaming, erratic muscle movements, and rapid eye activity.
- Harder to wake someone up during REM than during slow-wave sleep.
- Most people wake up on their own during a REM episode.
- Muscle tone drops, brain O2 usage rises, and pulse and blood pressure become variable.
- ACh levels go up.
- The brain kicks into high gear, boosting brain <SleepLib word="metabolism">metabolism</SleepLib> by up to 20%.

### What happens to your body during REM sleep?

REM sleep is thought to aid memory by strengthening the neural connections in your brain. This might be why your dreams during REM are often more memorable.

During REM, your brain also releases <SleepLib word="hormones">hormones</SleepLib> that contribute to your mental well-being.

REM sleep is crucial for memory storage and waking up feeling alert and refreshed.

Your brain waves in REM are high-frequency, low-amplitude beta waves. While your eyes dart around, your muscles are mostly relaxed or paralyzed, preventing you from acting out your dreams.

### Why REM sleep matters

Your brain is complex and needs proper regulation. One way to do that is through quality sleep, and REM sleep is a cornerstone. Even <SleepLib word="nap">naps</SleepLib> can be helpful.

Boosting your REM sleep offers numerous perks, such as stress reduction, mood improvement, and increased productivity.

One key advantage of more REM sleep is stress relief. Skimping on sleep boosts cortisol levels, raising your blood pressure and heart rate and possibly leading to anxiety and depression.

Another upside is mood enhancement. Lack of REM sleep can reduce <SleepLib word="serotonin">serotonin</SleepLib> levels, the <SleepLib word="neurotransmitters">neurotransmitter</SleepLib> that helps regulate mood and happiness.

### How much REM sleep do you need?

The sleep quality you get isn't just about the hours you spend in bed. Over-sleeping but still feeling worn out? You're probably missing quality sleep, even if you're in bed for 10+ hours.

Research underscores the importance of REM sleep for both mental and physical wellness.

Several factors like age, bedtime, and pre-sleep activities can impact the duration of your REM sleep.

Often called "dreamy" or "paradoxical" sleep because it's full of vivid dreams, REM is hard to pin down in terms of a healthy hour count for adults.

While adults generally need 7-9 hours of sleep per night, there's no one-size-fits-all answer for how much REM is required.

### How long does REM sleep last?

Your first REM phase kicks in about 90 minutes after you fall asleep, usually lasting 10-15 minutes. The duration gradually stretches with each sleep cycle.

By the final cycle, a REM phase can last close to an hour.

On average, expect four to five sleep cycles during a typical eight-hour sleep.

### Do you dream during REM sleep?

Yes, REM sleep is the stage most often linked with dreaming.

<InternalLink word="remSleep">REM Sleep</InternalLink> generally occurs in the final stage of your sleep cycle. Don't confuse this with the last sleep cycle; it's the final part of each sleep stage.

In REM, your brain is super active, even more so than in other sleep stages. Your brain waves mimic those when you're awake, and rapid eye movements come from bursts of electrical activity.

What you experience in dreams relates directly to how your brain processes sensory information.

Dreams come in two flavors: REM and NREM.

Dreams during REM are usually more vivid, colorful, and easier to remember than NREM dreams, which are less intense.

## What are the different sleep stages?

There are four <SleepLib word="stagesOfSleep">stages of sleep</SleepLib> plus an awake stage: Awake, N1, N2, N3, and REM. The Awake stage isn't truly a sleep stage, as you're still conscious.

NREM sleep includes stages N1 to N3, each deeper than the last. These stages make up about 75% of <SleepLib word="totalSleepTime">total sleep time (TST)</SleepLib>. The N2 stage accounts for the majority of this time.

A typical sleep cycle includes four to five rotations through these stages: N1, N2, N3, N2, REM. Each cycle lasts around 90 to 120 minutes. REM stages lengthen, and deep sleep stages shorten as the night progresses.

### Awake/Alert

This is stage W. Whether your eyes are open or closed determines this stage.

### N1 - Light sleep

Stage 1 is a <InternalLink word="lightSleep">light sleep</InternalLink> that lasts 1 to 10 minutes. It’s easy to wake from this stage, which leads into N2.

### N2 - Deeper sleep

In this stage, your heart rate and body temperature drop. Lasting about 25 minutes in the first cycle, this stage becomes longer in later cycles. It accounts for nearly 45% of total sleep.

### N3 - Deep sleep

Also known as <SleepLib word="slowWaveSleep">SWS</SleepLib>, N3 is the hardest stage to wake from. This is when the body repairs itself. Sleepwalking, night terrors, and bed-wetting often occur here.

### REM Sleep

Brain activity spikes in this stage, leading to dreams. REM stages start about 90 minutes into sleep and lengthen throughout the night.

## How do I know if I'm getting enough REM sleep?

A healthy adult should spend 20-25% of sleep in the REM stage. That’s about 90 minutes if you sleep 7-8 hours. This percentage decreases as you age.

## How to measure REM sleep?

The most common method is an <SleepLib word="electroencephalograph">EEG</SleepLib>. This device records your brain's electrical activity, helping to identify your sleep stages.

### What is an EEG?

An EEG is a test that doctors use to measure your brain’s activity. The most common type is the event-related potentials (ERP) EEG.

## What can I do to get enough sleep?

### How much sleep do I need?

Adults need 7-9 hours of sleep each night. If you feel tired during the day or see a dip in performance, you may need to adjust your <InternalLink word="sleepHabits">sleep habits</InternalLink>. Lack of REM sleep can lead to issues like depression and memory loss.

## Conclusion

REM sleep is vital and complex, marked by rapid eye movements and dreams. Our brains cycle between REM and non-REM sleep every 90 to 120 minutes. Regulating your brain is crucial, and sleep helps you do that.

Getting more REM sleep offers several benefits like reducing stress and boosting mood. In this stage, the brain is as active as when you're awake.
